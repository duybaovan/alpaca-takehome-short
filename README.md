## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup (Python 3.11+ required)

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv alpaca_venv
source alpaca_venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# CLI for Fastapi(not sure if recent change, but needed to manually install fastapi-cli as the base lib for fastapi didn't come with it)
pip install fastapi-cli

# Start the server
fastapi dev main.py
```

### Frontend Setup (Node.js 18+ required)

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Default Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Next.js application
  - `src/components/`: Reusable React components
  - `src/app/`: Next.js app router pages
- `backend/`: FastAPI application
  - `app/main.py`: API endpoints

## Development

- Frontend runs on port 3000 with hot reload enabled
- Backend runs on port 8000 with auto-reload enabled
- API documentation available at http://localhost:8000/docs

## Submission

1. Create a private GitHub repository
